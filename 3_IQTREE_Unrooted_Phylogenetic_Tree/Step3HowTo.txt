Next Step: Use Aliview to Check Alignment, Trim/Remove Problematic Sequences

With our multiple sequence alignment now generated, we’re going to view this graphically using the tool aliview (https://ormbunkar.se/aliview/). 
As with the other tools we’re going to assume you’ve successfully downloaded these, and dive straight into the analyses. 
We’ll use aliview to examine the MSA, see whether there are any issues, and manually trim all the sequences.

With aliview navigate to File -> Open File -> yellow_fever_epiphylo/2_Multiple_Sequence_Alignment_Generation/NCBIVirus_YFVSelectAlignedSeqs.fasta and double click to open.

Then navigate to File -> Save as Fasta and save this file as yellow_fever_epiphylo/3_IQTREE_Unrooted_Phylogenetic_Tree/NCBIVirus_YFVSelectAlignedTrimmedSeqs.fasta

The very top genome will be our reference genome - we’re going to start by deleting this. Click the panel with the sequence name on the LHS to highlight the genome and then rightclick and “Delete Selected Sequence”. 

We're now going to trim our sequences to remove ????????

Close your current conda environment (the one we made for MAFFT) by running the following command:

conda deactivate

Next Step: Use IQTree to Generate Unrooted Phylogenetic Tree

Now create a new and specific conda environment for IQTREE by running the following command 

	conda create --name iqtree

and then typing “y” into the console when prompted. This will create a fresh conda environment for you to install IQTREE into. Install IQTREE by running:

	conda install -c bioconda iqtree (See https://anaconda.org/bioconda/iqtree for further details)

With IQTREE successfully installed, now run the following command:

	conda activate iqtree

and then change to the relevant directory where the trimmed fasta file is i.e. 

	cd 3_IQTREE_Unrooted_Phylogenetic_Tree

and then:	

	iqtree -nt 4 -s NCBIVirus_YFVSelectAlignedTrimmedSeqs.fasta -m GTR+F+I+G4 -alrt 1000

This may take a while, but the output will be a series of files including a tree file that we’ll use FigTree to view in the next step of this tutorial. The output from this step will be an unrooted, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree for the sequences that you’ve collated.
